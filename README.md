# CSE 108: Object-Oriented Programming Language Sessional

## Course Overview

CSE 108 is a 1.5 credit hour sessional course offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). The course is designed to provide hands-on experience with the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), complementing the theoretical knowledge gained in CSE 107: Object-Oriented Programming Language.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains assignments and projects implemented in **Java** and **C++**. Each assignment demonstrates the application of core OOP principles.

## Assignments and Projects

### 1. **Java Assignments**
   - Focus on applying OOP principles in Java.
   - **Key Topics Covered**:
     - **Inheritance**:
       - Implementing hierarchical relationships between classes.
       - Utilizing `super` and overriding methods in derived classes.
     - **Polymorphism**:
       - Method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.
       - Abstract classes and interfaces.
     - **Encapsulation**:
       - Using access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) to restrict access.
       - Getter and setter methods for controlled access to class fields.
     - **File I/O**:
       - Reading and writing data to files.
       - Handling exceptions during file operations.

   - **Example Work**:
     - Creating a system for managing a library, including book classes and user interactions.
     - Implementing an employee management system using inheritance and file-based persistence.

### 2. **C++ Assignments**
   - Focus on implementing OOP concepts using C++.
   - **Key Topics Covered**:
     - **Inheritance**:
       - Base and derived class relationships.
       - Overriding base class methods and calling parent class constructors.
     - **Operator Overloading**:
       - Customizing operators like `+`, `-`, and `<<` for user-defined types.
     - **Friend Functions**:
       - Enabling external functions to access private members.
     - **Polymorphism**:
       - Using virtual functions to implement dynamic binding.
     - **Exception Handling**:
       - Handling runtime errors with `try-catch` blocks.
     - **Templates**:
       - Implementing generic programming using function and class templates.

   - **Example Work**:
     - Designing a banking system with account hierarchies (e.g., savings, current, fixed deposit).
     - Implementing a basic vector class with overloaded operators for mathematical operations.
